Built a dual-stage analytics solution using clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical) for customer segmentation and ML models (CART, Random Forest, ANN) to predict insurance claim status with high accuracy and business-aligned recommendations.

### Description:
This end-to-end project combined unsupervised and supervised learning to uncover customer insights and build predictive models for a travel insurance firm. Key phases included:

ðŸ”¹ Part 1: Clustering & Segmentation
- Applied Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means to segment customers by spending, credit limit, and payment behavior
- Used Dendrogram, Elbow Curve, and Silhouette Score to optimize 3-cluster solution: High, Medium, and Low spenders
- Created detailed cluster profiles and proposed targeted marketing strategies for each

ðŸ”¹ Part 2: Predictive Modeling for Claims
- Modeled claim status using CART, Random Forest, and ANN
- Handled skewed data with feature scaling, label encoding, and outlier treatment
- Evaluated models on accuracy, AUC, F1-score, and selected Random Forest as the final model with highest overall performance
- Emphasized recall to reduce costly false negatives in insurance claim predictions

This project highlights your ability to combine clustering, classification, model evaluation, and business recommendations into a unified data mining pipeline.

ðŸ“… Timeline: Novemberâ€“December 2021

ðŸ“¦ Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, CART, Random Forest, ANN, GridSearchCV, ROC AUC, Silhouette Score
